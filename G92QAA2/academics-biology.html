                    This laboratory page aims to enhance one’s understanding of the digestive system, its function, and the
                    processes involved in digestion. Understanding the digestive system is essential as it helps one better
                    understand how one’s body processes one’s food which helps in maintaining good health and a balanced diet.
                    It also provides a basis for understanding how various digestive illnesses and disorders are caused and 
                    how to prevent them. The simulation activity helps one understand the digestive system by helping one 
                    visualize how different organs function and what happens if a certain organ is removed. For instance, 
                    removing the gallbladder will cause the body to have difficulty digesting fats as it is the organ that 
                    stores bile, a fluid that aids in the digestion of fat, which means one should limit the consumption of 
                    fatty food. Simulation of the digestive system also helps one understand what would happen if the sequence 
                    of processes is altered and enables one to manipulate the model to understand the organ and its parts.

                        When we put the bananas and crackers in the zip lock, the food we put in seems to represent our food
                        bolus. Once it goes out of the esophagus, it will fall into the stomach to start the digestion stage.

                        The water acts as the gastric juices that breaks down the food bolus. We started noticing this when
                        the banana and crackers were becoming more mushier and easier to break apart when the water was
                        poured in, like the hydrochloric acid in the stomach.

                        The biomolecule components inside the food could be digested carbohydrates like smaller
                        polysaccharides and disaccharides, and protein being digested into small polypeptides due to pepsin
                        in the stomach.

                        The zip-locked bag represents the stomach itself. We noticed this because of the banana, crackers,
                        and water, which have similar functions to the stomach. The crushing motion on the banana and crackers
                        is like the stomach's churning motion, this is the part where the food bolus' proteins will be digested
                        and turned into chyme.

                    After crushing the meal in the zip lock, it was transferred to an old sock. It filtered the entire liquid mixture, 
                    and we used another cup to force all of the liquid out of the sock until only the somewhat solid stuff remained. 
                    The liquid running out of the sock reflects nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which is represented by the 
                    sock. The liquid in the dish depicts the bloodstream, which is where all of the liquid ended up. The solid substance
                     of the sock now represents feces, and the sock represents the large intestine. Finally, the solid substance is
                     pushed out of the cup hole. This simulates feces exiting the digestive tract or elimination.

                    For this part of our experiment, four paper tissues and four graduated cylinders, each filled with 100mm of water, 
                    were prepared. The paper tissues had varying folds (in the first image, from left to right: no fold, 3 folds, 4 folds, 
                    2 folds). The tissues were dipped in the water and the amount absorbed (measured from the loss of water in the cylinder) 
                    was compared. Of the four, the tissue with four folds absorbed the most, possibly because the folds gave it more surface 
                    area to absorb more. This experiment is comparable to the absorption process that happens in the small intestine. More 
                    specifically, the folded tissue is similar to the folded villi lining in the small intestine. Its folded structure helps 
                    in absorption just like how the folded tissue took up more water, because of its increased surface area.

                    During the experiment, we filled two containers with a mixture. Jar A (the first image) contained a Water-Liquid 
                    dishwasher mixture, while Jar B (the second picture) had oil and water on top of each other. Both Jars were shaken 
                    and observed after the fact, which showed that bubbles from the soap in Jar A and some of the oil from Jar B continued 
                    to cling onto the wall of their respective containers. This is a representation of what bile does in the digestive 
                    process. Bile is a chemical produced by your liver and stored in the gallbladder, which when released breaks down fatty 
                    acids, hence functioning as a chemical digestive process.

                <p>
                    As we conclude our experiment, we have learned lots of things from both studying and simulating the digestive
                    system. With our knowledge from both the classroom and the lab, we have a great knowledge of when food is
                    digested and how it's broken into small pieces and converted into stools. Now I know that when I eat food,
                    there are very complex processes inside us that filter and convert food into glucose, amino acids, fatty
                    acids, and more that give nutrients to the human body. Other than that, there are enzymes like pepsin that
                    turn proteins into smaller particles that go into the small intestine which leads them to the anus. And when
                    times comes, these small particles become stool ending the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we reflect on the digestive system, I realize that when we eat food, there are extraordinary processes
                    inside our body that we don't think of all the time. But now with our great knowledge of things, we can appreciate
                    how amazing these things are.
