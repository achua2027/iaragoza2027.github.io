            <h5>Sonnets by Cecil Erikah Paringit</h5>
            <h3>No time for Second Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Thinking about the youthful days<br>
                Similar to a drum, the heart is pounding<br>
                With no shield, its rhythm loudly playing<br>
                Leaving you behind due to the rhythm's sways<br>
                The moment to be dreaming<br>
                You look into oneself directly in the eye<br>
                Then you say,<br>
                I long to dance, the music has me grooving<br>
                <br>
                There is nothing that may hinder our motion<br>
                Let us forsake our plans and live resembling golden segments<br>
                And proceed to sway as if we are carefree<br>
                There is no need for such apprehension<br>
                We have skills to regain when we plummet<br>
                Under the twilight, no use for speech, as our actions are our lead</p>
            <h3>The World of Harmony</h3>
            <p>Tongues and letters, we’re diverse worldwide<br>
                No words are present when music plays<br>
                Though as strangers, in dance, our ties coincide<br>
                Thus, we're bound, in harmony, friendship sways<br>
                <br>
                No need to fret, let's just sing and dance<br>
                This joy is ours, our hearts confess<br>
                Even clamor holds a tune, to us, a chance.<br>
                Each lives to their own boom and pow's finesse<br>
                <br>
                Even ant's steps march in a melodious tone<br>
                If there is a God of Music, here’s a message for you<br>
                Gather notes, for dancing and singing, to us is known<br>
                The wondrous feeling, indeed, rings true<br>
                <br>
                Music is our breath, in it we thrive and grin<br>
                No peril in here, so breathing in.</p>

            <h5>Sonnets by Ely Exekiel Miclat</h5>
            <h3>Aspirations</h3>
            <p>In shadows deep, where the unknown wind blows<br>
                "I know nobody knows," the secret spins<br>
                A journey traced where every soul begins<br>
                A shared sin, where the weary heart glows<br>
                On life's rough canvas, dreams may start to fray<br>
                Yet, in the struggle, a tale to tell<br>
                "Dream until your dreams come true," a swell<br>
                In the symphony of night, where dreams hold sway<br>
                Half my life unfolded in written pages<br>
                Wisdom gleaned from fools and sages' grins<br>
                Sing with me, let the melody unfurl<br>
                For the year's laughter and the tear's lament<br>
                "Dream on, dream on, dream on," the chorus roars<br>
                Through every trial, find your special place<br>
                In dreams, the soul finds solace and farewell</p>
            <h3>Kombat Thrill</h3>
            <p>Upon the streets, I rise from defeat's heat

                Served my time, seized my fleeting chances<br>
                Rose from the ground, back on my two feet <br>
                Just a soul, with the hunger to enhance<br>
                In this world so quick, changes can't be beat<br>
                Trading passion for fame, as our lives march on<br>
                Don't lose your grip on dreams, the past's last pulse<br>
                Fight for them, breathe them to life, and take your stance<br>
                It's the eye of the tiger, fierce and bold<br>
                Thrill of the fight, a modern tango<br>
                Rise up to a challenge, a story unfolds<br>
                Lone survivor shadowing in dark of the night<br>
                With a watchful eye, he takes control<br>
                Combat thrill echoes, in life's eternal trance</p>
